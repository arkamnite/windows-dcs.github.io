## Welcome to the Guide (2)

We all love Microsoft Windows- but it isn't always as convenient as UNIX-like systems when it comes to software development. Accordingly, there are a set of tools and techniques you can use to make it a bit more homely- things like a terminal, package management, and the like. Luckily, the following guide will try and lay down the fundamentals so that you know what to do every time you need a new tool (rather than walking you through every specific install without explaining things).

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/arkamnite/windows-dcs.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
