## Installing a terminal 

### Why install a terminal application?
As mentioned previously, the command prompt isn't necessarily as ideal as a UNIX style terminal. As you study the shell in CS133 (professional skills), you'll want somewhere to practice the new commands you learn- all of which will not work natively on Windows.

### Installing Git Bash
I personally prefer to install Git and then use Git Bash, as this hits two birds with one installer- you install Git source control and a pretty terminal at the same time.
